This currently does not apply to existing controls, as it is there for testing.\r\n* You will still need to use `Styles` from the `gui.styles` package until the `canvas` package is fully complete.\r\n* The `Color` class can be used to get known colors or to create your own that has variables for values with or without alpha, or alpha on its own.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* CheckedListBox is almost complete, but should not be used yet.\r\n\r\n## Current Features\r\nThe following controls can be used:\r\n\r\n* TextBox\r\n* TextControl (just a simple label)\r\n* Button (can add images)\r\n* CheckBox\r\n* RadioButton\r\n\r\nYou can find sample code in Main.hx in the src folder.\r\n\r\nFor best performance, turn vsync off and hardware on, and turning the fps limit up.\r\nIf you are using a laptop with an integrated graphics card, this library may be suboptimal.\r\nThis library is ideally optimal on systems with a dedicated graphics card, and these controls are designed to work\r\nalongside other graphics components, bitmaps and game features.\r\nTo fully benefit from hardware-acceleration, it is recommended that OpenFL version 3.x is installed and compiled in `next`.\r\n\r\nTo use this in HTML5, it is recommended to switch the `webgl` flag on compile, such as `openfl build html5 -Dwebgl`.\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\nAs features are completed, they will be shifted up to the \"Current Features\" in the order that you see them here.\r\n\r\n * CheckedListBox (partially complete - does not work quite yet)\r\n * ComboBox\r\n * ListBox\r\n * NumericUpDown\r\n * ProgressBar\r\n * Slider\r\n * ToolTip\r\n * ContextMenuStrip\r\n * MenuStrip\r\n\r\n### Advanced Controls\r\n\r\n * FlowLayoutPanel\r\n * GroupBox\r\n * TabControl\r\n * DragDropInterface\r\n * ListView\r\n * PropertyGrid\r\n * StatusStrip\r\n * ToolStrip\r\n * TreeView\r\n * DataGridView\r\n\r\n### Utility Controls\r\n\r\n * Calendar\r\n * PrintDocument\r\n\r\n### Dialogs\r\n\r\n * Dialog\r\n * MessageBox\r\n * ColorDialog\r\n * FileDialog*\r\n * FolderBrowserDialog*\r\n * FontDialog\r\n * PageSetupDialog*\r\n * PrintDialog*\r\n\r\n*Will probably look into native controls for this functionality on Windows, Linux and Mac, and a simpler explorer-like\r\nfile dialog that you may place into a game.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
